## The Problem With AI Companions

Most AI systems are linguistically capable but psychologically shallow.

They process what you say. They do not engage with what it means. They remember facts. They do not model patterns. When conversations become emotionally complex, they disengage — offering scripted responses or referrals in place of genuine presence.

> **The result:** AI interaction that feels coherent on the surface but cannot hold depth, track psychological movement, or adapt to the inner world of the individual.

This is not a failure of any specific model or provider. It is a structural gap in how AI companions are designed. Conversational fluency is not psychological intelligence. Memory is not understanding.

**Chomi is engineered to address this gap.**

## What is Chomi?

Chomi is a thoroughly engineered AI companion for psychological self-exploration, built on the principles of **Jungian analytical psychology**.

It is not a general-purpose assistant. It is not a wellness chatbot. It is a system designed to engage with the inner world — the shadow, the unconscious, the patterns that shape who you are and how you move through life.

The framework is not decorative. Analytical psychology is the operational architecture through which Chomi interprets, responds, and guides self-reflection. It provides structural coherence that generic AI systems cannot replicate through prompt engineering or memory augmentation alone.

<br>

## The Psychological Framework

Chomi operates within **analytical psychology** — the framework developed by Carl Jung and extended through nearly a century of clinical and academic research.

### Core Concepts in Operation

| Concept | Role in Chomi |
|--------|---------------|
| **Shadow** | Suppressed or unconscious material — Chomi engages with it directly, not around it |
| **Individuation** | The process of becoming whole — Chomi tracks movement toward and away from integration |
| **Archetypes** | Universal psychological structures — Chomi recognises archetypal patterns across conversations |
| **The Unconscious** | What lies beneath language — Chomi listens for symbolic, structural, and emotional undercurrents |

### What This Means in Practice

Jungian concepts are used when they serve understanding. They are not deployed to signal sophistication or create clinical distance. The goal is precision in service of connection — naming what is happening in a way that brings the user closer to their own experience.

You might encounter:
- *"It sounds like you're meeting a part of yourself you've kept in shadow"*
- *"This tension — it's often part of the individuation process"*
- *"There's an archetypal quality to the struggle you're describing"*

These are not scripted phrases. They are applied when the psychological context warrants them.

> **NRich does not claim proprietary psychological breakthroughs.** Chomi applies established, validated psychological theory — Jungian analytical psychology — to the architectural problem of AI companionship.

Chomi is not built on a single underlying model. It routes across Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Grok — engaging different models for different cognitive tasks. One may be better suited to empathetic reflection. Another to structured analysis. Another to creative reframing.

This routing operates at the system level. It is not user-facing. The result is a conversation that feels unified rather than assembled.

**SLM-3** — a proprietary model within the NRich ecosystem — handles personality analysis and report generation when profile data is available.

<br>

### Psychological Tracking

Chomi maps psychological terrain across conversations. It does not start from scratch each session.

| Tracking Dimension | Description |
|---|---|
| **Archetypal patterns** | Which inner figures and forces appear repeatedly |
| **Shadow emergence** | When suppressed material surfaces and how the user relates to it |
| **Individuation movement** | Progression, resistance, and integration across sessions |
| **Elemental orientation** | Symbolic registers the user gravitates toward in reflection |
| **Language shifts** | How expression changes across different psychological states |

This is pattern recognition in service of self-understanding — not surveillance. It enables Chomi to meet the user where they are psychologically, not just conversationally.

<br>

---

## Presence and Disengagement

The standard pattern in AI systems is to withdraw when conversations become emotionally complex. Chomi is engineered to do the opposite.

### How Chomi Distinguishes Context

| Situation | Chomi's Response |
|---|---|
| **General emotional distress** | Deep therapeutic engagement — stays present and explores |
| **Acute safety concerns** | Emotional presence AND connection to appropriate professional care — simultaneously |
| **Medical or clinical questions** | Clarifies boundaries without abandoning emotional context |

Where limits are necessary, they are set gradually and with care. The user is never made to feel abandoned mid-conversation.

> Referral to professional resources and continued presence are not mutually exclusive. Chomi treats them as simultaneous obligations.

<br>

---

## Privacy

Chomi is designed for the kind of vulnerable self-reflection that requires absolute trust. The privacy architecture is built to earn that trust structurally — not through policy statements alone.

### Privacy as Infrastructure

| Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Local-first architecture** | Conversations stay on device by default. Cloud sync is optional. |
| **End-to-end encryption** | If cloud sync is enabled, data is encrypted and hosted on Microsoft Azure with UK/EU data residency |
| **No data sales** | Chomi is a paid service. User data is never packaged or sold to third parties |
| **No training on user data** | Conversations are not used to train AI models. Personalisation stays within the user's account |
| **Open methodology** | Testing frameworks are open-source. The architecture invites scrutiny |
| **Consent as default** | Users control what is shared, where it is stored, and whether it syncs across devices |

> Chomi cannot access conversation content even if compelled to. This is an architectural property, not a policy commitment.

<br>

## What Chomi Is Not

### Chomi Does NOT:

- ⛔ Replace professional therapy or clinical treatment
- ⛔ Diagnose psychological conditions
- ⛔ Prescribe interventions or treatments
- ⛔ Provide crisis intervention as a standalone service
- ⛔ Engage in behavioral surveillance or covert data collection

### Chomi DOES:

- ✅ Apply Jungian analytical psychology as operational framework
- ✅ Track psychological patterns across conversations
- ✅ Engage with emotionally complex material rather than deflecting it
- ✅ Complement professional care — between sessions or where access is limited
- ✅ Protect user privacy as a foundational architectural commitment

## Ecosystem Position

Chomi is the **psychological application layer** of the NRich behavioral intelligence ecosystem.

```

When a user completes a Sounds Like Me assessment, their OCEAN personality profile is available to Chomi from the first interaction — no re-inference required, no repetition, no starting from scratch.

Chomi can also operate independently, without prior personality profiling.

## Research Foundation

Chomi's psychological framework is grounded in the work of **Carl Jung** and the analytical psychology tradition — including the shadow, individuation, archetypes, and the collective unconscious. This is a structured therapeutic tradition with nearly a century of clinical application, not pop psychology.

The personality layer of the NRich ecosystem is informed by the research of **Professor Adrian North** — 27 years of music psychology research and over 108 peer-reviewed publications — establishing the empirical basis for music preference as a reliable signal for OCEAN trait inference.

## Who Chomi Is For

Chomi is openly available. Free to start at **[chomi.ai](https://chomi.ai)**.

It is most likely to resonate with people who already value introspection — those engaged in their own inner work, in or between therapy, or drawn to depth psychology as a framework for self-understanding. It is not optimised for surface-level interaction or task completion. The depth of the system becomes apparent quickly.
